ClinicalPath-AI: Dynamic Diagnostic Pathway Optimization via RL🩺 OverviewClinicalPath-AI is an advanced decision-support system that personalizes the diagnostic journey for cardiovascular patients. Instead of following a linear, static set of tests, this system uses Reinforcement Learning (DQN) and Sparse Autoencoders (SAE) to determine the most efficient sequence of medical examinations.The goal is to reach a high-confidence diagnosis (Healthy, CAD, HF, or Stroke) using the minimum number of tests necessary, reducing patient wait times and healthcare costs.🚀 The Clinical Pipeline1. Patient Fingerprinting (SAE)The system begins by ingesting 11 initial vitals (Age, BP, BMI, etc.). A Sparse Autoencoder compresses these into a 4-dimensional "Clinical Fingerprint." This latent representation captures the patient's underlying health state more effectively than raw data.2. Adaptive Sequencing (MAB/DQN)The core of the "Pathway" is a Deep Q-Network agent that treats diagnosis like a strategic game:State Space: The patient's fingerprint + a dynamic log of completed test results.Action Space: Choosing between 9 diagnostic tests (e.g., Troponin, Echo, Stress Test) or committing to one of 4 final diagnoses.Reward Logic: The agent is penalized for every test ordered (-1) but heavily rewarded for an accurate final diagnosis (+50). This forces the model to learn the shortest path to accuracy.📂 Project StructureFileRole in the Pathwayapp.pyDeployment: Flask web interface for real-time diagnostic simulation.mab_environment.pyLogic: The "Rulebook" defining medical states and sequencing rewards.build_autoencoder.pyFeature Engineering: Training the SAE to generate patient fingerprints.run_diagnostic_final.pyInference: Terminal-based execution of the full diagnostic pathway.generate_tsne_plot.pyVisualization: t-SNE mapping of how the model clusters different diseases.📊 Performance & Clinical ImpactAccuracy: >95% success rate in matching ground-truth clinical diagnoses.Efficiency: Average test reduction of ~30-40% compared to standard "full panel" testing.Interpretability: Uses t-SNE visualizations to verify that the autoencoder is correctly separating different clinical conditions in the latent space.🛠️ Quick StartInstallationBash# Clone the repository
